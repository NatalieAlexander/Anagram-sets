# Welcome to Anagram Sets 🌐

## Introduction
Anagran sets allows anagram wordplay, where the user provides a word length e.g., 5 and the programme generates all possible anagrams with the given word length (found in a given lexicon file). 

## How to Use 🤔
+ Clone this repository to your local machine.
+ Save a lexicon text file as "EnglishWords.txt" in the same directory as your anagramsets.py script.
+ Run the anagramsets.py script.
+ Enter an integer indicating the desired word length.
+ Enter the name of your output file - this is where your anagram results will be saved.
